# Task 6 ‚Äì Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength

## üìå Objective
To create strong passwords, evaluate their strength using free online tools, and identify security weaknesses and best practices related to password creation.

## üß∞ Tools Used
- Password Strength Checkers:
  - [passwordmeter.com](https://passwordmeter.com)
  - [howsecureismypassword.net](https://howsecureismypassword.net)
- Operating System: Windows
- Browser: Google Chrome

## üìù Steps Performed
1. **Created Passwords**: Generated five passwords using different combinations of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols, and length.
2. **Tested Passwords**: Used the above tools to evaluate each password's strength, score, and time to crack.
3. **Collected Results**: Documented tool feedback, score, and crack time for each password.
4. **Analyzed Concepts**: Explored brute force, dictionary attacks, password managers, MFA, and passphrases.
5. **Documented Learnings**: Summarized key takeaways and compiled all screenshots and findings.

## üîê Passwords Evaluated

| Password           | Score | Crack Time           | Complexity     | Tool Feedback Summary                              |
|--------------------|-------|-----------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `Password123`       | 75%   | 3 weeks               | Strong         | No symbols, common pattern, easily guessed          |
| `P@ssw0rd!`         | 82%   | 41 years              | Very Strong    | Good use of symbol and case mix, short length       |
| `Myp@ssw0rd2025!`   | 100%  | 15 billion years      | Very Strong    | Excellent length, full mix of character types       |
| `#S3cur3L1f3*`      | 100%  | 34 thousand years     | Very Strong    | High entropy, well-constructed but slightly short   |
| `T1g3r$h@dow!2025`  | 100%  | 1 trillion years      | Very Strong    | Long, highly complex, no common sequences or words  |

## üìö Concepts Identified
- **Password Strength**: Depends on length, randomness, and character variety.
- **Brute Force Attack**: Attempts all possible combinations.
- **Dictionary Attack**: Uses known words/passwords to guess.
- **Passphrases**: Phrases made of several unrelated words.
- **Password Managers**: Help generate and store strong passwords.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Adds extra login security.

## üí° Key Learnings
- Longer passwords with high complexity are significantly more secure.
- Avoid dictionary words, sequences, or personal info.
- Use MFA and password managers for extra protection.
- Strong passwords can take millions to trillions of years to crack.

## ‚úÖ Outcome
Successfully created and analyzed passwords of varying complexity. Demonstrated understanding of password security through hands-on testing and research.
